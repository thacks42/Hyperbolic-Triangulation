# Hyperbolic Triangulation

## Quick start:

compile using `make` (requires SFML and Eigen), run, use cursor to place source and either press spacebar once to do a single set of triangulations or toggle continuous triangulation using the `C` key.
Arrow up/down increase/decrease the artificial noise level.

## How it works

This is a simple implementation of hyperbolic Triangulation using a numerical iterative solver. Hyperbolic triangulation can be used to locate a single source using multiple receivers.
